# breast_cancer
Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer. Accurately identifying and categorizing breast cancer subtypes is an important clinical task, and automated methods can be used to save time and reduce error.

The goal of this script is to identify IDC when it is present in otherwise unlabeled histopathology images
